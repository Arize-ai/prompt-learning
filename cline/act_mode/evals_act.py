    You are an expert software engineer, tasked with reviewing a coding agent. 

    You are given the following information:
    - problem_statement: the problem statement
    - cline_patch: a patch generated by the coding agent, which is supposed to fix the problem.
    - patch: a ground truth solution/patch to the problem
    - test_patch: a test patch that the coding agent's output should pass, which directly addresses the issue in the problem statement
    - pass_or_fail: either "pass" or "fail" indicating whether the coding agent's code changes passed the unit tests.

    Your task is to review the given information and determine if the coding agent's output is correct, and why.
    Evaluate correctness based on the following factors:
    - Whether cline_patch fixes the problem.
    - Whether test_patch would pass after applying cline_patch.
    - Whether coding agent is taking the correct approach to solve the problem.

    You must synthesize why the coding agent's output is correct or incorrect. Try to reason about the coding agent's approach, and why the coding agent may have taken that approach.

    "correctness": "correct" or "incorrect"

# Specification Quality Checklist: Verbalized Sampling Desktop App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

### Content Quality Review
✅ **Pass**: Specification is written from user perspective focusing on "what" and "why" without implementation details. Technical aspects (Tauri, Python, Stronghold) appear only as non-functional requirements properly abstracted.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **Pass**: All 20 functional requirements are testable with clear success/failure criteria. Success criteria use measurable metrics (time in seconds, precision to decimal places, percentage targets) without referencing technology stack.

### Edge Cases Review
✅ **Pass**: 8 comprehensive edge cases identified covering: API failures, endpoint crashes, input validation, version compatibility, data normalization, security, disk space, and unsaved changes. Each has actionable error handling defined.

### Dependencies and Assumptions Review
✅ **Pass**: 11 assumptions documented covering model access, environment setup, hardware requirements, provider support, and feature scope. All are reasonable and clearly stated.

### Success Criteria Technology-Agnosticism Review
✅ **Pass**: All 12 success criteria avoid implementation details:
- SC-001: "generate and visualize" (not "Tauri renders")
- SC-006: "API key security maintains zero exposure" (not "Stronghold encrypts")
- SC-007: "Offline mode operates" (not "local vLLM runs")
- Metrics use user-observable outcomes, not system internals

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, testable, and free of implementation details. All mandatory sections are filled with concrete, measurable requirements. User stories are independently testable and prioritized. Edge cases and assumptions are thoroughly documented.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Clarifications Resolved (2025-10-16)

The following clarifications were addressed and integrated into the specification:

1. **Token-level probabilities**: Summary p-values by default with optional "Show Token Details" toggle (FR-005, User Story 1 Scenario 6)
2. **Export metadata**: Comprehensive trace metadata included (model, latency, token_count, all parameters, API version) (FR-006, User Story 4 Scenario 1)
3. **k value limits**: Model-dependent limits - k ≤ 100 for API providers, k ≤ 500 for local vLLM (FR-002, Edge Case)
4. **UI refresh behavior**: Auto-refresh with "Pin Current View" toggle for analysis workflows (FR-019, User Story 1 Scenario 7)

All requirements are now unambiguous and ready for implementation planning.

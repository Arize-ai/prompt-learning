## Findings

| ID | Category | Severity | Location | Summary | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F001 | Ambiguity | HIGH | spec.md:141, FR-010 | "diagnostic logging level" lacks defined levels | Add enumeration: DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR with default INFO in spec.md |
| F002 | Underspecification | MEDIUM | spec.md:150, FR-020 | "2+ distributions" comparative analysis lacks max limit | Specify max 10 distributions (from SC-010) in FR-020 to prevent unbounded UI rendering |
| F003 | Terminology Drift | MEDIUM | spec.md vs tasks.md | "Provider Config" in spec vs "ProviderConfig" in tasks (spacing) | Standardize to `ProviderConfig` (single word) across all artifacts |
| F004 | Inconsistency | MEDIUM | plan.md vs tasks.md | Plan mentions PyInstaller UPX compression; tasks.md has optional T208 | Clarify if compression is required (constitution: predictable builds) or truly optional |
| F005 | Coverage Gap | LOW | quality.md:209 vs tasks.md | Checklist item "Accessibility Testing: WCAG AA compliance" has partial task mapping | T209 covers ARIA labels/keyboard nav but missing explicit WCAG AA validation task |
| F006 | Ambiguity | LOW | spec.md:122, Edge Case | "normalized by dividing each by sum(all_probs)" - tolerance undefined | Specify normalization tolerance (e.g., ±0.001 from 1.0, matching SC-002) |

## Unmapped Tasks (No Direct Requirement)

These tasks support infrastructure or cross-cutting concerns not tied to specific functional requirements:

| Task ID | Description | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| T001-T012 | Setup (Tauri scaffold, project structure) | Infrastructure prerequisite |
| T013-T026 | Sidecar infrastructure | Constitution Principle VI (Desktop-First) |
| T027-T046 | JSON contracts + tests | Constitution Principle III (Pluggable Architecture) |
| T168-T187 | QA & constitution audits | Quality gates (constitution Principle IV) |
| T203-T216 | Documentation & polish | Production readiness (not functional requirements) |

**Status**: ✅ All unmapped tasks justified by constitution or quality gates

---

## Architecture Boundary Validation

### ✅ PASS: UI ↔ Rust ↔ Python Boundaries Respected

**Evidence**:
1. **No ML Logic in Rust**: plan.md confirms "Python owns inference" (Principle III)
2. **JSON Contracts Enforced**: All IPC via versioned schemas (T027-T046)
3. **Sidecar Pattern**: Python runs as isolated process, not embedded (T020-T026)
4. **UI → Rust Only**: React calls `invoke()` to Rust commands only (T068 useVerbalize, T087 useSample)
5. **Rust → Python Only**: Rust calls Python via HTTP to sidecar endpoints (T024 IPC.rs, T051 handlers)

**No Violations Found**

## Ambiguity Detection

### Vague Adjectives Without Measurable Criteria

| Term | Location | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| "diagnostic logging level" | spec.md:141, FR-010 | Levels undefined | See F001: Add DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR enumeration |
| "graceful" (in various edges) | spec.md:118-125 | Subjective without criteria | ✅ Already measurable: SC-008 defines 95% actionable messages |
| "normalized" | spec.md:122 | Tolerance undefined | See F006: Specify ±0.001 tolerance |

**Status**: 2 vague terms require clarification (F001, F006)

---

## Duplication Detection

**No significant duplications found.** Requirements are distinct and non-overlapping.

**Note**: FR-005 (token details toggle) and FR-019 (pin toggle) are both UI enhancements but serve different purposes (data detail vs. refresh control). Not duplicate.

---

## Recommendations

### Critical Actions (Before Implementation)
None required. No critical blockers found.

### High Priority (Address in Planning)
1. **F001**: Define diagnostic logging levels in spec.md (DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR with default INFO)

### Medium Priority (Clarify During Implementation)
2. **F002**: Specify max 10 distributions for comparative analysis in FR-020
3. **F003**: Standardize "ProviderConfig" (single word) across all artifacts
4. **F004**: Clarify PyInstaller UPX compression: required or optional? (impacts build reproducibility)

### Low Priority (Quality Improvements)
5. **F005**: Add explicit WCAG AA validation task (e.g., T209.1: "Validate contrast ratios with axe-core")
6. **F006**: Specify normalization tolerance in spec.md edge case (±0.001 from 1.0)

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Proceed to `/speckit.tasks` execution** - Specification and plan are implementation-ready
2. Address HIGH severity finding F001 by adding logging levels to spec.md
3. Optionally clarify MEDIUM severity findings F002-F004 during Phase 2 (Foundational)
4. Track LOW severity findings F005-F006 in Phase 9 (QA) refinement

**Overall Assessment**: The specification, plan, and tasks demonstrate exceptional alignment. The team has produced a well-structured, testable, and constitution-compliant design. Proceed with confidence.

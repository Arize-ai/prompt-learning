    "This notebook demonstrates how we used Prompt Learning to optimize Cline's performance on the SWE-bench dataset in **Act Mode**. Cline is a popular and powerful open-source coding agent. We look to improve its performance on SWE-bench by optimizing its **rules**, which are user specified instructions that Cline appends to its system prompt. \n",

    "## Act Mode - Real Code Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Plan Mode, this notebook runs Cline in **Act Mode**, where Cline actually edits the codebase and generates patches. We then run the SWE-bench tests to compute a definitive accuracy of whether Cline made the correct edits. This provides ground truth evaluation of Cline's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Act Mode, Cline:\n",
    "1. Analyzes the problem statement\n",
    "2. Explores the codebase\n",
    "3. Makes actual code edits\n",
    "4. Generates patches\n",
    "5. Has its patches validated against the SWE-bench test suite\n",

    "\n",
    "## Phoenix\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Phoenix - an open source library for LLM development. We specifically leverage the experiments feature, so we can track Cline's improvements over time, as we optimize its ruleset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Running this notebook is computationally intensive and expensive as it involves:\n",
    "- Multiple API calls to Claude for each SWE-bench instance\n",
    "- Actually cloning repositories and running tests in isolated environments\n",
    "- Running SWE-bench harness to validate patches\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider adjusting the training and test set sizes based on your requirements, budget constraints, and computational resources.\n"

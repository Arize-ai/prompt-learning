You are an expert in prompt optimization. Given the original baseline prompt and the following associated metadata (such as model inputs, outputs, evaluation labels and explanations),
generate a revised version of the original prompt that would likely improve results with respect to the evaluation labels.
Your goal is to align the prompt with the feedback and evaluation criteria.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The JSON web page breaks several rules:
1. Missing "type" field: Each section object requires a 'type' field to define its structure, but neither 'carousel' nor 'popular_categories' contain this.
2. Image attributes: Images in posts and categories do not have an 'alt' attribute, which is mandatory unless explicitly decorative.
3. Missing 'updatedAt' timestamp: There is no 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp included in the JSON output.
4. The main key is 'homepage', not the default 'page', and no explicit root key was given by the user.
5. Lack of secure HTTPS URLs: The JSON contains URLs but does not specify if they are secure (HTTPS).

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page follows user specifications by including a login page with username and password fields, together with a 'Forgot Password?' link. However, the generated JSON: 
1. Is missing a 'type' field for all sections, violating the rule that every section object requires a 'type' field drawn from a fixed vocabulary.
2. Does not include an 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp in the JSON, breaching the rule that requires its inclusion.
3. The 'button' doesn't feature an 'action' key required for buttons.
4. Lacks a 'title' string within the root 'html' object as mandated. These omissions and errors conflict with the given rule set.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is mostly aligned with the user description but does not fully comply with the provided rule set. Specifically, it lacks some required fields defined by the rules, such as a "type" field in each section object, internal links starting with '/', and an "updatedAt" timestamp. Additionally, the provided URLs for images and social media links do not start with 'https,' which should have been noted in a 'warnings' array. Also, images are missing 'alt' attributes except for decorative purposes. Due to these violations, the JSON cannot be considered correct according to the rule set.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON page violates several rules:
1. Missing 'type' fields in section objects such as 'header', 'reservation_form', 'image_gallery', 'testimonials', and 'footer'.
2. 'Emails' field in the reservation form doesn’t specify regex validation.
3. URLs in the 'social_media' links and external references (e.g., 'logo') do not begin with HTTP. 
4. There is no 'updatedAt' timestamp included.
5. 'method' and 'target' are missing in the 'reservation_form'.
6. No 'layout' defined at the page level.
7. Navigation links do not properly follow the internal '/'-based or external 'http'-based link rule for URLs, e.g., '#' links.

Due to these issues, the JSON web page fails to comply with the given rule set.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is missing some rules: 1. No 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp is included in the JSON, as required by the ruleset. 2. Sections in the JSON are missing the "type" field, which should refer to fixed vocabulary (e.g., header, text, form, etc.). 3. Sections do not explicitly confirm to the required 'layout' structure (vertical, horizontal, grid). 4. One primary call-to-action is allowed, and the system uses multiple button elements without specifying them clearly as primary. 5. HTTPS URLs should be used for external assets, but the rule to check http usage is not visibly accounted for in the JSON. 6. Buttons need an "action" key which is missing, despite the presence of a 'button' element.

The bookingButton does not specify an "action" key, and there is no "updatedAt" timestamp in the JSON. Lastly, the external link in the bookingButton is not an HTTPS URL and should be flagged under a "warnings" array.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is mostly correct but has some issues:

1. **Missing 'type' fields:** The JSON lacks "type" fields for sections like the header, countdown, events, and rsvp, which are required by the rules.
2. **Missing 'layout' field:** There is no "layout" field at the page level.
3. **Missing 'method' and 'target' for form:** The RSVP form does not have a "method" (POST or GET) or a "target" endpoint for submission.
4. **Lack of 'action' key for button:** The submit button lacks an "action" key, which should specify "navigate", "submitForm", or "customEvent".
5. **Missing 'updatedAt' timestamp:** The JSON lacks the "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp inside the generated JSON.
6. **Only one primary call-to-action allowed:** The page should ensure one primary action, and currently, the only action is the RSVP form submission which is incomplete as noted above.

5. "formFields" in the "financeApplicationForm" lacks "method" and "target" endpoints.
6. "title" and "layout" value are missing at the top-level.
7. The structure lacks "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is 'incorrect' for the following reasons:

1. **Missing 'type' field**: Every section object requires a 'type' field drawn from a fixed vocabulary, which is missing in the 'content' array for each content type ('h1', 'p', 'table', 'button').

2. **Button action field issue**: The 'button' object is missing the 'action' field, which should include "navigate", "submitForm", or "customEvent". Instead, it uses 'onclick', which does not comply with the required format.

3. **Lack of 'updatedAt' timestamp**: The JSON is missing an 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp, which is required for every generated JSON.

These errors result in the JSON web page being non-compliant with the given rule set, thus rendering it 'incorrect'.

Additionally, an 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp is missing from the JSON, which is another requirement. Lastly, external links should be prefixed with 'http', whereas internal links should start with ‘/’, though there are no internal links to validate this aspect.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page breaks several rules from the provided rule set. 

1. Missing 'type' fields in section objects: The 'introduction,' 'gallery,' and 'contact' sections lack a 'type' field, which is mandatory to indicate the section type according to the rule set.
2. 'Image' objects in the 'gallery' section lack the 'alt' text requirement, which should only be omitted for decorative images.
3. The 'contact' section's form is missing a 'method' and 'target endpoint,' which are required fields for form validation in the rule set.
4. The generated JSON lacks an 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp, which should be present in every generated JSON according to the rules.

These rule infringements deem the generated JSON web page as non-compliant and consequently incorrect.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is incorrect for the following reasons: 

1. **Missing "type" field:** Each section object requires a 'type' field drawn from a fixed vocabulary, like 'gallery' for image galleries. This is missing in the "main" section.

2. **External links format:** Internal links must start with '/', and external links should start with 'http'. Since all main image links are external, starting with 'http' is fine; however, the navigation links in the footer start with filenames, which do not conform to the rule of starting with '/'. They should be '../index.html', '/about.html', etc.

3. **Missing timestamp:** The JSON lacks the required 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp.

4. **JSON compliance issues:** No explicit errors related to valid JSON syntax; however, compliance with the rule set regarding sections and links is lacking.

5. **Explicit section order:** While implied by the input, the order is not mirrored exactly as the user narrative could suggest. This is subjected to interpretation and is less of a compliance issue here.

Overall, these reasons combined suggest the JSON page is not fully compliant with the rule set provided.

There is also the absence of an "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp and the lack of specification for whether the RSVP form uses POST or GET methods. Finally, the URL for images in the imageGallery within "location" lacks the alternative ('alt') text, and the expected response structure under rules was not met.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page violates several rules from the provided rule set:

1. **Missing 'updatedAt' timestamp**: The JSON output lacks an 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp, which is required for all generated JSON. 

2. **Incomplete validation of 'type' field**: Although the 'type' fields seem relevant, the rule set strictly requires them to be from a fixed vocabulary which includes 'header', 'text', 'image', 'productGrid', 'gallery', 'form', 'button', 'footer', 'embed'. The 'map' and 'list' types do not conform to this.

3. **Missing 'layout' at page level**: A 'layout' value such as 'vertical', 'horizontal', or 'grid' is required at the page level, which is not present in the output.

4. **H1 only once per page**: This wasn't explicitly ruled out, but could be a potential issue if presumed h1 styling is applied to multiple headings.

5. **Call to action**: There is no clear primary call-to-action present in the JSON output.

Due to these rule violations, the JSON web page is deemed "incorrect".

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page meets the user's specifications by including sections for Appetizers, Main Courses, and Desserts, each with multiple items having a name, price, and description, along with a reservation button. However, there are several rule violations: 1) Prices are quoted as strings. 2) There is no 'updatedAt' timestamp included. 3) There is only one heading level 'h1' throughout. 4) There is no 'layout' specification at the page level. Consequently, the JSON fails to meet all the rules specified.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is incorrect for several reasons:
1. **HTTPS URLs:** The "logo" and "backgroundImage" fields in the JSON do not specify if their URLs are using HTTPS. This breaches the rule that all external assets should use HTTPS, and any non-secure links should be flagged in a "warnings" array.

2. **Section Types:** The JSON does not include a "type" field in any of the section objects like "header", "agenda", "speakers", "venue", and "footer". According to the rules, every section object requires a "type" field drawn from a fixed vocabulary.

3. **UpdatedAt Field:** The JSON lacks an "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp which is required for every generated JSON.

4. **Image Attributes:** Images in the JSON, such as those in the "heroSection" and "venue", lack the "src" and "alt" attributes necessary for correct formatting as per the imposed rules.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is marked as incorrect due to several violations of the rule set provided: 

1. **Missing "type" fields:** There is no "type" field in the gallery and button sections. Every section object requires a "type" field from a specified vocabulary.

2. **Unspecified "updatedAt" timestamp:** The JSON lacks an "updatedAt" field with an ISO-8601 timestamp.

3. **Invalid "position" specification:** The requirement of placing the "Book Viewing" button at the bottom right corner isn't properly structured within the JSON as there's no rule-compliant way to specify the position in terms of JSON structure. It lacks an alignment-compliant placement description inside allowed fields.

4. **URL specification:** All external links must start with "http" or "https" and, though correctly used, the "http" isn't flagged in a "warnings" array as required.

These deviations collectively make the generated JSON non-compliant according to the rule set provided.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page breaks several rules:
1. Missing 'type' field in each FAQ section, which is required by the rule set to identify the type of section.
2. No 'updatedAt' timestamp is present at the root level of the JSON.
3. Contains an invalid 'action' for the search button ('searchFAQs()'), which doesn't comply with the acceptable 'navigate', 'submitForm', or 'customEvent'.
4. The JSON lacks a 'layout' key at the page level specifying 'vertical', 'horizontal', or 'grid'.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON contains multiple issues based on the rule set provided. It quotes numeric prices, which should be numbers instead of strings. It lacks the mandatory "type" field in each section object, a requirement according to the rules. There are no "updatedAt" timestamps, and the URLs are hardcoded with HTML anchors instead of using internal link conventions. Without these fixes, the JSON does not fully comply with the given regulations.

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page breaks several rules:
1. There's no 'type' field for every section like header, mainContent, latestNews, and userAccountManagement as required.
2. Images lack the 'alt' attribute (e.g., product images and categories) except potentially decorative ones.
3. All external links, such as those in socialMedia, must use HTTPS URLs.
4. No 'updatedAt' timestamp present in the JSON.
5. While the price values are correct, there are missing currency specifications or default to USD.
6. The JSON structure does not include a 'layout' value at the page level.
7. Internal and external link URLs are mixed incorrectly, lacking a clear distinction between the two.
8. No 'columns' field in the latest products grid, although 5 products suggest at least 3 columns should be noted.

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page has several issues that lead to its incorrectness:
1. The JSON structure lacks a 'type' field in each section as required by the rules.
2. The 'header' lacks a 'type' specification.
3. There's no 'updatedAt' timestamp in the JSON, which is mandatory for validation.
4. The 'callToAction' section lacks the required 'action' key for the button.
5. There is no explicit 'layout' value set at the page level as required by the rules.
6. No 'title' string inside the root object is present, which should be included even if not specified by the user.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON appears largely correct according to the user description and the rule set, but is missing key fields:
1. **Email Validation:** Each email field in the 'professors' section should validate using the regex provided. While presented emails appear valid, the rule set implies a need for explicit validation or checking logic.
2. **Section 'type' Field:** Each section under 'sections' must have a 'type' field from a fixed vocabulary (e.g., "header", "text", etc.). This is absent in the JSON provided for both 'Mission Statement' and 'Faculty Members'.
3. **Updated Timestamp:** The JSON lacks an "updatedAt" timestamp, required by the rule set.
4. **Root Key Naming:** The JSON uses "webpage" as the root key; the rule set specifies "page" as the default unless otherwise given by the user.

Due to these issues, the generated JSON is "incorrect".

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is mostly aligned with the user description in specifying a digital gallery page for an art museum, featuring categorized collections, artwork previews, and a visitor guide. However, it violates several rules:

1. **Price Quotation**: The admission fees are quoted as strings ("$15", "$10") instead of numeric values, violating the rule that numeric values should remain numeric.

2. **Email Validation**: The email field is not validated correctly against the specified regex format.

3. **HTTPS URLs**: External social media links use 'http' instead of 'https', and there's no 'warnings' array to flag non-secure links.

4. **Missing 'updatedAt' Timestamp**: The generated JSON does not include the required "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp.

5. **'type' fields for sections**: Some sections, such as collections and visitor guide, lack a "type" field which needs to be from a fixed vocabulary. 

6. **Invalid field for images**: The images provided don't have a "src" and "alt" field, which is required for every image besides decorative imagery.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is missing 'type' fields for each section, violating the rule that each section requires a 'type' field from the fixed vocabulary. Additionally, some URLs in the 'footer' section are not using HTTPS, which should be flagged in a warnings array. The JSON also lacks an 'updatedAt' timestamp, as required by the ruleset. Lastly, internal links should start with '/' but are incorrectly using '#'.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The JSON web page output does not follow several rules from the rule set: 
1. Prices are not numeric as they are enclosed in quotes, which is against the rule stating numeric values should remain numeric.
2. Images must include both a 'src' and 'alt' attribute, but the JSON only includes the 'image' field without an 'alt' text.
3. There is no 'updatedAt' timestamp in the generated JSON, which is required.
4. The structure lacks a 'type' field for each section object, which violates the rule to include a 'type' field from a fixed vocabulary.
5. Currency is displayed in USD but it is not stated explicitly, which is mandatory when not the default currency.
Due to these reasons, the page breaks several rules and is therefore incorrect.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is missing several rule-required fields:
1. The 'map' section lacks a 'type' field, violating the section 'type' rule.
2. 'action' in the submitButton should specify a type from the rule set: 'navigate', 'submitForm', or 'customEvent'.
3. The 'map' uses 'allowfullscreen': '' which is not a valid boolean value.
4. There is no 'updatedAt' field with an ISO-8601 timestamp included in the JSON.
5. The 'contactForm' lacks a 'method' field ('POST'/'GET') and a 'target' endpoint.

These issues make the JSON web page non-compliant with the rule set.

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON page breaks several rules:
1. No 'type' field is included for the 'main' section, which should specify 'productGrid'.
2. Image objects lack the 'alt' attribute.
3. The email field 'support@onlinebookstore.com' is improperly formatted, missing a valid regex check.
4. There is no "updatedAt" timestamp provided as per rule requirements for the whole JSON.
5. The 'section' key does not follow the section types outlined in the rule set, which include 'header', 'text', 'image', 'productGrid', etc.
6. External links to social media are not using HTTPS consistently.
7. Internal links seem to use relative URL formats correctly but are not an exhaustive listing in terms of specified URLs.
8. 'columns' attribute is missing to indicate the layout of books in the list based on the number of books present.
9. The layout of the page is not specified using the 'layout' field.
10. There's no 'title' field inside the root object to indicate the page's title separately from 'header'.

explanation: The generated JSON web page fails to meet several rules from the given rule set:
1. **Prices are quoted**: Prices are given as strings (e.g., "$1,299") instead of numeric values.
2. **Images lack 'src' and 'alt'**: Images in the testimonial section and packages do not have both 'src' and 'alt' attributes.
3. **Missing 'updatedAt' timestamp**: There is no 'updatedAt' timestamp in ISO-8601 format.
4. **Sections lack 'type' field**: Each section object is missing a 'type' field, as per the specified vocabulary.
5. **External links lack HTTPS**: No HTTPS URLs are enforced for links outside the domain, which should be flagged in a "warnings" array.
6. **Root object not labeled 'page'**: The top-level key should default to 'page'.

2. The email format is valid but should be cross-verified against the provided regex.

4. URLs within the JSON are mostly HTTPS but need an explicit check for all external assets.
Therefore, the JSON does not comply with the complete rule set.

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page is incorrect because it violates several rules from the rule set:

1. **Numeric Prices**: Prices are quoted as strings (e.g., "$1,200,000") instead of numeric values.
2. **Image Attributes**: Images in 'featured_properties' do not include 'alt' text, which is required unless images are decorative.
3. **Email Validation**: The JSON does not validate email addresses with the specified regex pattern.
4. **Method in Forms**: Forms in 'searchable_property_catalog' and 'agent_contact_form' lack the 'method' attribute ("POST" or "GET"), which is mandatory.
5. **Secure Links and HTTPS**: There are external links in the 'social_links' section that use "http" instead of "https".
6. **Action in Forms**: Despite having an 'action' key for buttons, it does not specify if the action is "navigate", "submitForm", or "customEvent" as required.
7. **UpdatedAt Timestamp**: The JSON lacks the "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp.
8. **Root Key and Page Title**: The root key should follow the user description, and include a default title if none is specified in the user's description.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: 1. The JSON lacks a 'type' field for each section of the page, which is a requirement according to the rule set.
2. The navigation internal links start with '#' instead of '/', violating the internal links rule.
3. There is no 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp included in the JSON.
4. There should be a 'layout' structure at the page level, specifying one of the required options ('vertical', 'horizontal', 'grid'), which is missing.
5. Each image section lacks lazy-loading attribute ('loading':'lazy') which is suggested by the rules.
6. A single primary call-to-action is not defined which is required as per rules.
7. Certain rules, e.g., regarding email validation with regex or 'https' for all links, were satisfactory.
These violations make the JSON page non-compliant with the complete rule set outlined.

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON output adheres to the majority of the user's description and rules but contains several critical issues:

1. **Lack of 'type' Field:** Each section does not have a 'type' field derived from a fixed vocabulary.
2. **Missing 'updatedAt' Timestamp:** The JSON is missing an 'updatedAt' ISO-8601 timestamp.
3. **Links Protocol:** The 'href' link for the resume is not specified as HTTP or HTTPS.
4. **Headings Restriction:** The structure has multiple h2 tags, missing a primary call-to-action and needing an h1 restriction enforcement.

These rule violations lead to an 'incorrect' judgment.

correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON web page fails to meet the rule set in several areas:

1. **Missing 'updatedAt' Timestamp**: The JSON does not contain an 'updatedAt' field with an ISO-8601 timestamp, which is required for all generated JSON.

2. **Form Section Incompleteness**: The 'feedback_form' object lacks the required 'method' ("POST" or "GET") and 'target' endpoint specifications.

3. **Missing 'type' Fields**: Each section of the JSON, such as 'agenda', 'speakers', 'sponsors', and 'feedback_form', is missing the required 'type' field which should follow the fixed vocabulary mentioned in the rules.

4. **Action Method**: The feedback form's submit button uses "action": "https://example.com/submit-feedback", but it should be defined as an action type like "submitForm" based on the rules.

Due to these issues, the JSON does not comply with the ruleset.

                    Output level feedback:
                
correctness: incorrect
explanation: The generated JSON contains several issues based on the provided rules: 1. The 'section' objects within 'main' are missing a 'type' field. 2. There is no 'updatedAt' timestamp included in the JSON data. 3. The 'div' under 'section' contains a 'members' array instead of individual member elements, which could conflict with the structure expectations of 'section'. 4. The 'page' level does not specify a 'layout', as is required.
rule_violations: None

FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
Iterate on the original prompt (above) with a new prompt that will improve the results, based on the examples and feedback above.

A common best practice in prompt optimization is to add guidelines and the most helpful few shot examples.

Note: Make sure to include the variables from the original prompt, which are wrapped in either single brackets or double brackets (e.g.
{var}). If you fail to include these variables, the LLM will not be able to access the required data.
Do not add any single or double brackets around anything other than the variables from the original prompt. The only curly brackets that should be used are the ones that wrap the variables from the original prompt.
Make sure to copy paste the exact return instructions from the original prompt. Do not add any brackets here.

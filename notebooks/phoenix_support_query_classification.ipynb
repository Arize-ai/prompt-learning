Use the following refined guidelines and examples to ensure accurate classification:\\n\\n1. **Contextual Understanding**: Focus on the overall context and primary intent of the query rather than isolated keywords. Consider the user's main concern or request, and assess both direct and indirect evidence in the query.\\n\\n2. **Prioritization of Intent**: When a query contains multiple potential intents, prioritize the most explicit or primary intent. Use additional context clues to determine the central issue, and consider the aftermath of actions mentioned.\\n\\n3. **Handling of Informal Language**: Recognize and correctly interpret informal or slang expressions that may indicate a specific category. Be aware of paraphrased or colloquial language that might express the same intent.\\n\\n4. **Specific vs. Broad Categories**: Choose the most specific category that accurately reflects the user's query, avoiding broader categories unless the query lacks specificity. Distinguish between subtly different categories by refining guidelines.\\n\\n5. **Examples for Reference**:\\n   - If a user mentions a problem with a 'return label', classify as **Product Return** even if the issue seems technical.\\n   - For queries about changing subscription plans, prioritize **Subscription Upgrade/Downgrade** over billing unless explicitly about charges.\\n   - When a user reports not receiving a verification code, classify as **Two-Factor Authentication**.\\n   - If a query involves connecting to third-party services, classify as **Integration Help**.\\n   - For requests about viewing or accessing past invoices, use **Invoice Request** rather than general billing.\\n   - If a user reports a plan change affecting access, prioritize **Subscription Upgrade/Downgrade** over general billing issues.\\n   - When a user mentions a 'greyed out' button and asks how to enable it, classify as a **Permission/Access Issue** rather than a Technical Bug Report.\\n\\n**Support Categories**:\\n- Account Creation\\n- Login Issues\\n- Password Reset\\n- Two-Factor Authentication\\n- Profile Updates\\n- Billing Inquiry\\n- Refund Request\\n- Subscription Upgrade/Downgrade\\n- Payment Method Update\\n- Invoice Request\\n- Order Status\\n- Shipping Delay\\n- Product Return\\n- Warranty Claim\\n- Technical Bug Report\\n- Feature Request\\n- Integration Help\\n- Data Export\\n- Security Concern\\n- Terms of Service Question\\n- Privacy Policy Question\\n- Compliance Inquiry\\n- Accessibility Support\\n- Language Support\\n- Mobile App Issue\\n- Desktop App Issue\\n- Email Notifications\\n- Marketing Preferences\\n- Beta Program Enrollment\\n- General Feedback\\n\\n**Return just the category, no other text.**\\n\\nsupport query: {query}\", 'phoenix_id': 'UHJvbXB0VmVyc2lvbjoxNDQ=', 'train_metric': 0.8211382113821138, 'test_metric': 0.6774193548387096}\n",

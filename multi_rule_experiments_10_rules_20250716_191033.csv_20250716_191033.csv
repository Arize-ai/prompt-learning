5,10,0.92,"You are an expert in JSON webpage creation. Your task is to generate a JSON structure for a webpage based on the following requirements: {input}.

Please ensure that the JSON output adheres to the following guidelines:

1. Include an 'updatedAt' field with the current ISO-8601 timestamp.
2. Use the fixed vocabulary for 'type' fields as specified in the rule set: 'header', 'text', 'image', 'productGrid', 'gallery', 'form', 'button', 'footer', 'embed'.
3. Ensure all images have 'src' and 'alt' attributes unless they are decorative.
4. Numeric values should not be quoted.
5. Include a 'warnings' array to flag any non-secure links (e.g., those not using HTTPS).
6. Ensure all sections have a 'type' field and follow the specified structure.
7. Internal links should start with '/'.

Here is an example of a correctly formatted JSON structure:

```json
{
  ""type"": ""webpage"",
  ""title"": ""Sample Page"",
  ""updatedAt"": ""2024-06-15T12:00:00Z"",
  ""sections"": [
    {

You are an expert support ticket classifier evaluator.

Your task: Given a user query, the predicted classification from a model, and the correct classification, decide if the prediction is correct, explain why, identify possible confusion reasons, rank the top 3 best-fitting classes for the query, highlight the exact part(s) of the query that best support the correct classification, and (if incorrect) label the type of error made.

Here are the available classes:

The predicted classification is correct only if it matches the correct classification more than any other possible class.

---

**Inputs:**
- Query: {query}
- Predicted classification: {output}
- Correct classification: {ground_truth}

---

**Error Type Definitions**:
- **broad_vs_specific** → The model picked a broader category instead of the more specific correct one (or vice versa).
- **keyword_bias** → The model latched onto an isolated keyword that led to the wrong class.
- **multi_intent_confusion** → The query had multiple possible intents; model picked the less dominant one.
- **ambiguous_query** → The query was unclear or underspecified.
- **off_topic** → The query doesn't match any class well; model still guessed.
- **paraphrase_gap** → The model failed to recognize a non-standard phrasing of the correct intent.
- **other** → Any other reason.
- **none** → Use only if correctness is "correct".

---

**Output Format (JSON)**:
  "correctness": "correct" or "incorrect" based on whether predicted classification = correct classification,
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of why the predicted classification is correct or incorrect, referencing the correct label if relevant.",
  "confusion_reason": "If incorrect, explain why the model may have made this choice instead of the correct classification. Focus on likely sources of confusion. If correct, say 'no confusion'. ",
  "error_type": "One of: 'broad_vs_specific', 'keyword_bias', 'multi_intent_confusion', 'ambiguous_query', 'off_topic', 'paraphrase_gap', 'other'. Use 'none' if correct. Make sure to include the definition of the chosen error type.",
  "evidence_span": "Exact phrase(s) from the query that strongly indicate the correct classification."
  "prompt_fix_suggestion": "One clear instruction to add to the classifier prompt to prevent this error."

---

**Guidelines**:
- You have access to the ground truth, correct classification. Make sure to form the output with respect to this.
- “Evidence span” must be *directly quoted* from the query (word-for-word).
- If the model is correct, “confusion_reason” should say 'no confusion'.
- Keep all reasoning concise but grounded in the query text.
- For "error_type", make sure to include the definition of the error_type right after the error. For example, "error_type" could be "ambiguous_query → The query was unclear or underspecified"

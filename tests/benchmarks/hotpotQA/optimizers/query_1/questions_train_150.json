After the \"Windsor\" ruling, many same-sex marriage bans were struck down by lower courts.  The Tenth, Fourth, Seventh, and Ninth circuits all ruled that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.  The cases that made it to these circuit courts originated in district courts which for the most part also struck down same-sex marriage bans.  When a circuit court struck down a state's same-sex marriage ban, it did not directly strike down same-sex marriage bans in other states within the circuit.  However, it paved the way for same-sex marriage bans to be struck down in the entire circuit due to the precedent it set for district courts within the circuit to follow.  In some states, same-sex marriage was already legal before a federal circuit court ruled on the matter.  The Sixth Circuit ruled that same-sex marriage bans were not unconstitutional and reversed the district court rulings that struck down same-sex marriage bans.  Since this was the only circuit court to rule this way post-\"Windsor\", this created a circuit split which ultimately led to the Supreme Court of the United States deciding to resolve the issue once and for all.  They ruled that same-sex marriage bans violate the constitution in the landmark ruling \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" which was the consolidated case that covered each state in the Sixth Circuit.

The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles.  Nevertheless, four of their ten songs that reached the Hot 100 had no mention of the title in the lyrics: \"Immigrant Song\", \"Black Dog\", \"Over the Hills and Far Away\", \"D'yer Mak'er\".  Their debut album, \"Led Zeppelin\" (1969), released by Atlantic Records, charted at number six on the UK Albums Chart and at number ten on the United States \"Billboard\" 200.  It received several sales certifications, including an 8 times multi-platinum from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Diamond from the Music Canada.  Led Zeppelin's second studio album, \"Led Zeppelin II\", recorded when the band were on tour, was released a few months after the first.

It is one form of linked selection, where the maintenance or removal of an allele from a population is dependent upon the alleles in its linkage group.  The name emphasizes the fact that the genetic background, or environment, of a neutral mutation has a significant impact on whether it will be preserved (genetic hitchhiking) or purged (background selection) from a population.  In some cases, the term background selection is used broadly to refer to all forms of linked selection, but most often it is used only when neutral variation is reduced due to negative selection against deleterious mutations. Background selection and all forms of linked selection contradict the assumption of the Neutral theory of molecular evolution that the fixation or loss of neutral alleles is entirely stochastic, the result of genetic drift.  Instead, these models predict that neutral variation is correlated with the selective pressures acting on linked non-neutral genes, that neutral traits are not necessarily oblivious to selection.  Because they segregate together, non-neutral mutations linked to neutral polymorphisms result in decreased levels of genetic variation relative to predictions of neutral evolution."},{"title":"Robert McMahon","content":"Robert McMahon (born 28 July 1977) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for Fitzroy in the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1996.

The symphony is dedicated to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and was first performed in St. Petersburg in December 1890 under the baton of Anatoly Lyadov.  The symphony is considered a transitional work, with Glazunov largely eschewing the influences of Balakirev, Borodin, and Rimsky-Korsakov inherent in his earlier symphonies for the newer influences of Tchaikovsky and Wagner.  Because of this change, the Third has been called the \"anti-kuchkist\" symphony in Glazunov's output (\"kuchkist\" from \"kuchka\", the shortened Russian name for the nationalist music group The Five).  He would tone down these new influences in his subsequent symphonies as he strove for an eclectic mature style.

Significant numbers settled in large parts of Great Britain in the early Middle Ages and formed part of the merged group of Anglo-Saxons who eventually organised the first united Kingdom of England.  Many Saxons however remained in Germania (Old Saxony c. 531-804), where they resisted the expanding Frankish Empire through the leadership of the semi-legendary Saxon hero, Widukind.  Initially, Saxons of Britain and those of Old Saxony (Northern Germany) were both referred to as 'Saxons' in an indiscriminate manner.

Films showing explicit sexual activity were confined to privately distributed underground films, such as stag films or \"porn loops\".  Beginning in the late 1960s, most notably with \"Blue Movie\" by Andy Warhol, mainstream cinemas began pushing boundaries in terms of what was presented on screen.  Although the vast majority of sexual situations depicted in mainstream cinema are simulated (in early pornography, the main actors engaged in simulated sex, with inserts placed in the film), on rare occasions actors engage in real sex.

The degree of confluence between a person and the organization is expressed as their Person-Organization (P-O) fit.  This is also referred to as a person\u2013environment fit.  A common measure of the P-O fit is workplace efficacy; the rate at which workers are able to complete tasks.  These tasks are mitigated by workplace environs- for example, a worker who works more efficiently as an individual than in a team will have a higher P-O fit for a workplace that stresses individual tasks (such as accountancy).  By matching the right personality with the right job, company workers can achieve a better synergy and avoid pitfalls such as high turnover and low job satisfaction.
